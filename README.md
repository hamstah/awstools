## Authentication

Every tool supports the standard AWS authentication as well as sts sessions with the following options

* `--region`: Choose the aws-region to use
* `--assume-role-arn`: Assume the role before running. This is useful for cross account access.
* `--assume-role-policy`: Policy to use when assuming the role, can be used to drop permissions from the role.
* `--mfa-serial-number`: The new session will have its 2FA flag set.
* `--mfa-token-code`: The token code to use when using `--mfa-serial-number`. If not provided the tool will prompt for it.
* `--session-duration`: The length of the session, for example `--session-duration=1h`

### Checking release signatures

Download the signature from the release and use GPG to verify it

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
version=7.4.0
os=linux
arch=amd64
wget https://github.com/hamstah/awstools/releases/download/v${version}/iam-session_${version}_${os}_${arch} -O iam-session
wget https://github.com/hamstah/awstools/releases/download/v${version}/iam-session_${version}_${os}_${arch}.asc -O iam-session.asc
gpg --verify iam-session.asc iam-session
```

The signing key is

```
Primary key fingerprint: 5FC5 40A9 A2F2 B87B 9C49  3D9E 7D40 F516 7D5C 7058
```

### Checking the sha256 of binaries

* Get the `SHA256SUMS` files
  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  version=7.4.0

  wget https://github.com/hamstah/awstools/releases/download/v${version}/SHA256SUMS
  wget https://github.com/hamstah/awstools/releases/download/v${version}/SHA256SUMS.asc
  gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
  ```
* Check the sha256 of downloaded binaries
  ```
  find . -type f ! -name "*.asc" ! -name SHA256SUMS | xargs -Ifile grep file SHA256SUMS | sha256sum --check
  ```
